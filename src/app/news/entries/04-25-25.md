We had the best time connecting (and reconnecting!) with only the best people coming from BU, Brown, Harvard, MIT, and Tufts. A huge thank you to AISST and MAIA for organizing this event, and we're so glad that everyone enjoyed the 52 bagels we brought from New York! Much love to everyone â€” see you all soon!
